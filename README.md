# Neural_Networks

## Introduction to Machine Learning 2nd coursework for MSc AI at Imperial College London, academic year 2020-2021

Implemented from scratch a modular neural network "mini-library" using NumPy (could not use PyTorch or TensorFlow). 

* Forward and backward pass methods for a linear layer class
* Forward and backwards methods for Sigmoid and Relu activation layer classes
* Implement a multi-layer network class with linear and activation functions
* Implement a trainer class
* Implement a preprocessor class to perform min-max scaling such that the data is scaled to lie in the interval [0,1]
